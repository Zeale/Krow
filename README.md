> *A construct mindset documentation program.*

A somewhat simplistic (not really), GUI based program used for documenting the **Construct Mindset**.

Features:
   1. Documenting functions for Constructs, Laws, and Systems.
   2. Visualization of data for Constructs and Laws.
   3. Various little features here and there.

I'll add to this file and the rest of this repository as this program becomes more public; for now, I'm generally sticking to developing the program.
